 * (at least the congruence closure itself and also the proof recording
 * explanations [the unsat core extraction] seem to be simpler and suboptimal 
 * -- the HighestNode trick ? )
 * 
 * Hint: understand _pairNames as "Lookup" from the paper.
 * 
 * However, classList of a representative 
 * does not (physically) contain that representative (only logically)
