 * maintaining a triangular array where each entry is a @b PoComp
 * value. After each extension we compute the transitive closure
 * of the current relation. Assuming this was done for the previous
 * relation, it is enough to compute what has become "connected"
 * through the newly added value. In certain cases, this extension
 * fails as the new relation would be contradictory. This state
 * is represented by a null partial ordering.
 *
 * The set elements are denoted by IDs inside the class, which is
 * given by order of appearance, as explained below. The set
 * elements are abstracted via these IDs to increase sharing among
 * partial ordering objects. Hence, operations modifying the
 * objects are performed through static methods, and we get shared
 * heap-allocated objects, or null if the operation fails.
