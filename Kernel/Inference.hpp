/** Step-by-step guide to adding an inference to Vampire:
 *  1) Update the enum below with an entry for the new inference.
 *     The enum is sorted into simplifying, generating etc. inferences.
 *     The new inference must be placed in the appropriate section.
 *  2) Update the ruleName(..) function in Inference.cpp to return
 *     the name of the new inference. This name will be used in proof
 *     printing.
 *  3) In the /Inferences directory, create a *.cpp and *.hpp files to 
 *     contain the code which defines the functionality of the new inference.
 *  4) Vampire supports five types of inferences. Immediate simplifications,
 *     simplifications (like immediate simplifications, but occur later in the
 *     given clause loop), forward simplification, backward simplifications
 *     and generating inferences. The core functionality of each of these
 *     is specified via five abstract classes in InferenceEngine.hpp. The new 
 *     inference should inherit from one of these.
 *  5) In SaturationAlgorithm.hpp update the createFromOptions() function
 *     to attach the new inference to the relevant (generating, simplifying, ...)
 *     front. This ensures that the inference is actually carried out during
 *     the saturation loop.
 *  6) If the new inference involves an index of some sort then the following
 *     needs to be done:
 *     6.1) Update TermIndex.* / LiteralIndex.* (whichever is appropriate) to
 *          create a new index for this inference. Specify how the index will
 *          handle new clauses (will it index subterms of the clause, literals or
 *          something else? How will it handle these?).
 *     6.2) Update IndexManager.cpp create(...) function to return an 
 *          instance of the new index on request.
 *     6.3) Update inference code to override the attach(...) and detach(...) 
 *          methods of the InferenceEngine class. Request the index in the 
 *          attach(...) function and release in the detach(...) function.
 *
 *  Further notes on creating inferences:
 *  - Immediate simplification inferences cannot be linked to an index
 *  - For an inference that works at subterms, please consider carefully
 *    which iterator to use to return these subterms. In Vampire, terms are
 *    of the form f(type_args, term_args). In most cases, inferences should NOT
 *    be working on type arguments. Please view TermIterators.hpp for a list of
 *    iterators available.
 *  - TermSubstitutionTrees, do NOT carry out any type checking. Thus, in the case
 *    where either the search or query term is a variable, a type check needs to
 *    be carried out by the inference code. This check may be a unification check or 
 *    a matching check depending on whether the inference is using unification or
 *    matching. Please view Superposition.cpp for an example of a unification check
 *    and ForwardDemodulation for an example of a matching check.
