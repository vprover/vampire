   * Note about performance. It's not clear why, but pure AgeBasedPassiveClauseContainer
   * actually performs worse when trying to do the below LRS trick
   * (via mayBeAbleToDiscriminateClausesUnderConstructionOnLimits == true and exceedsAgeLimit),
   * However, I didn't check what the implication for unique solutions is, so it's fine to have
   * the LRS support, but don't expect it to beat Otter in this particular case.
   *
   * Possible explanation: some age-wise large clauses could still be effective (forward-)reducers
   * (since they may still be weight-wise small) and under Otter which backs up LRS (as opposed to Discount),
   * it's the reducers that could help reaching the empty clause before even getting selected.
   * (AWPassiveClauseContainer will keep these, because it only deletes those clauses which both queues consider bad.)
   *
   * On the other hand, the above pair of functions (mayBeAbleToDiscriminateChildrenOnLimits and allChildrenNecessarilyExceedLimits)
   * as implemented (and not bluntly inhertied from SingleQueuePassiveClauseContainer)
   * are now probably able to improve performace a tiny bit.
